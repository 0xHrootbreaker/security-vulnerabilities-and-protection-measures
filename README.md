## 📘 Project Overview  
This project explores one of the most critical vulnerabilities in cybersecurity —  
the **EternalBlue exploit**, which targets the outdated **SMBv1 protocol** in  
Windows operating systems (especially Windows 7).  

It demonstrates how the vulnerability works, simulates the attack in a virtual  
environment, and provides protection and mitigation measures against such  
exploits.
